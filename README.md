# KeyToTheCity
iOS Geolocation Game where users find virtual keys in their town to become king of their town. Playable in over 20,000 towns across America

Key to the City is a geolocation game. The app hides a single key in a random location in every city in America. Physically going to that location is the only way for players to take control and claim that city as their own.

With each acquired city, players' empires grow. A global leaderboard keeps track of the largest empires in the country. Rankings rise and fall as players can steal cities from one another by obtaining new keys. Using Facebook login, players can keep track of friendsâ€™ empires and claim them as their own.
